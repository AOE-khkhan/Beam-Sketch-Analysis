This is a piece of software application intended to analyse a beam-support system and gives out the maximum deflection of the
corresponding position of the force detected from the sketch drawn by the user.
The purpose of this application is to get an approximate magnitude and the position of the point of maximum deflection for various design
purposes. A video demonstrating the use of the software is uploaded here as well for reference.

The program has been written in MATLAB and the main file to run is named 'INK.m'
